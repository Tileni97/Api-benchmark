# API Benchmark Report
**Date**: 2025-04-24
**Candidate**: [Your Name]

## Key Findings
- Fastest API: Kraken (406.9ms avg)
- Most Consistent: Kraken (range: 265.2ms)
- Success Rate: All APIs achieved 100% availability

## Recommendations
1. Investigate why Gate.io (2583.6ms) is slower than competitors
2. Consider WebSocket implementation for real-time data
3. Document latency expectations for developers

## How This Relates to the Role
This test demonstrates my ability to:
- Design and execute API performance tests
- Analyze and visualize technical data
- Identify optimization opportunities
